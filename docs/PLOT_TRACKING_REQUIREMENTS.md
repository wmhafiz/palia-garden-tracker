#### **Architecture: Hybrid Enhancement Approach**

**Rationale**: Build upon existing infrastructure while adding individual plot capabilities as an optional enhancement.

##### 1. **Data Structure Evolution**

```typescript
// Extend existing TrackedCrop to support individual plots
interface EnhancedTrackedCrop extends TrackedCrop {
  // Individual plot tracking
  individualPlots?: { [plotId: string]: IndividualPlot };

  // Scheduling data
  schedule?: PlotSchedule;

  // Mode selection
  trackingMode: "bulk" | "individual";
}

interface IndividualPlot {
  id: string; // "A1", "B2", etc.
  position: { row: number; col: number };
  cropType?: string;
  fertilizers: string[];
  plantedAt?: Date;
  lastWatered?: Date;
  harvestHistory: Date[];
  status: PlotStatus;
  nextWateringTime?: Date;
  nextHarvestTime?: Date;
}

type PlotStatus =
  | "empty"
  | "growing"
  | "needsWater"
  | "readyToHarvest"
  | "overripe";
```

##### 2. **State Management Integration**

```typescript
// Extend UnifiedGardenStore with individual plot actions
interface EnhancedGardenStoreActions extends UnifiedGardenStoreActions {
  // Individual plot management
  setTrackingMode: (cropType: string, mode: "bulk" | "individual") => void;
  updatePlot: (plotId: string, updates: Partial<IndividualPlot>) => void;
  waterPlot: (plotId: string) => void;
  harvestPlot: (plotId: string) => void;

  // Scheduling
  refreshSchedule: (cropType?: string) => void;
  getUpcomingActions: (hours?: number) => ActionItem[];
  completeAction: (actionId: string) => void;

  // Batch operations
  batchWaterPlots: (plotIds: string[]) => void;
  batchHarvestPlots: (plotIds: string[]) => void;
}
```

##### 3. **UI Component Enhancement**

```typescript
// Enhanced TileComponent with individual plot support
interface EnhancedTileProps extends TileComponentProps {
  trackingMode: "bulk" | "individual";
  plotData?: IndividualPlot;
  onPlotClick?: (plotId: string) => void;
  showScheduleOverlay?: boolean;
}

// New components for individual tracking
interface PlotDetailModalProps {
  plotId: string;
  onClose: () => void;
  onSave: (updates: Partial<IndividualPlot>) => void;
}

interface ScheduleViewProps {
  upcomingActions: ActionItem[];
  timeRange: number; // hours to show
  onActionComplete: (actionId: string) => void;
}
```
